I started by updating the logo to look more stylish, while still maintaining the sense of fun of the original. Using, Adobe XD, I created a new layout that expands on the logo’s sense of style and fun. With responsive design in mind I made sure it looks beautiful whether viewed on a computer or from a mobile device.',
